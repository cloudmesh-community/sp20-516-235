## Benefits

### - Precise video analysis

Video Intelligence API automatically recognizes more than 20,000 objects, places, and actions in stored and streaming video. It also distinguishes scene changes and extracts rich metadata at the video, shot, or frame level. Use in combination with AutoML Video Intelligence to create your own custom entity labels to categorize content.

### - Simplify media management

Find value in vast archives by making media easily searchable and discoverable. Easily search your video catalog the same way you search text documents. Extract metadata that can be used to index, organize, and search your video content, as well as control and filter content for what’s most relevant.

## Products:

### 1. AutoML Video Intelligence :

AutoML Video Intelligence has a graphical interface that makes it easy to train your own custom models to classify and track objects within videos, even if you have minimal machine learning experience. It’s ideal for projects that require custom labels which aren’t covered by the pre-trained Video Intelligence API.  

### 2. Video Intelligence API :

Video Intelligence API has pre-trained machine learning models that automatically recognize a vast number of objects, places, and actions in stored and streaming video. It’s highly efficient for common use cases and improves over time as new concepts are introduced.

And you can pick either one of the products and which on would fit more your businees.

## Use Cases 

#### 1.Content moderation:

Identify when inappropriate content is being shown in a given video. You can instantly conduct content moderation across petabytes of data and more quickly and efficiently filter your content or user-generated content.

#### 2.Recommended content:

Build a content recommendation engine with labels generated by Video Intelligence API and a user’s viewing history and preferences. This will simplify content discovery for your users and guide them to the most relevant content that they want.


#### 3.Media archives:

Create an indexed archive of your entire video library by using the metadata from Video Intelligence API. Ideal for mass media companies, Video Intelligence API can automatically analyze content and make the results immediately accessible via the API.

#### 4.Contextual advertisements:

Contextual advertisements
You can identify appropriate locations in videos to insert ads that are contextually relevant to the video content. This can be done by matching the timeframe-specific labels of your video content with the content of your advertisements.
